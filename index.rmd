## Finding Social Science Data for Your Research {data-background="data1.jpg"}

##

> An approximate answer to the right question is worth a
great deal more than a precise answer to the wrong
question.

-John Tukey



## Plan your Research with a Literature Review {data-background="books.jpg"}

http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/


## Ask Yourself...


- How feasible or doable is your research question? 

- How many observations do you need? 

- Does the answer to your question have too many angles? If so, then your question might be too broad to answer on time.


		


## Structure and availability of data



| Unit of Analysis                                                                       	| Geography                                                                          	| Time-Period                                                             	| Frequency                                                                                              	|
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|-------------------------------------------------------------------------	|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| For which level do you want data?  Summary or Micro?  (individuals, counties, nations) 	| Is there a geographic  component to your topic?  (U.S., Sub-Saharan Africa, India) 	| Do you want a data for a  specific time period?  (1980-2000, 1930-1960) 	| How often do you want measures  for your variables?  (every year, every ten years, monthly, quarterly) 	|


## Data Providers

| Researchers                                                    	| Government Agencies                                                                                                                                                                       	| NGOs                                                                                                                                     	| Research Organizations                                                                                                   	|
|----------------------------------------------------------------	|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| Are there people you know who are doing this kind of research? 	| Think about government agencies - is the request for some official statistics or data that they'd be likely to collect and publish? (industry, agriculture, construction, disease, crime) 	| Are there councils or interest organizations devoted to the topic that might collect data independently? (HIV/AIDS, drugs, civil rights) 	| Would any specific research organizations be interested in the topic? (Pew, Roper, Gallup, NORC, NBER, World Bank, OECD) 	|

## Mind the 80/20 Rule

> It is often said that 80% of data analysis is spent on the process of cleaning and preparing the data. 


-Dasu and Johnson

##Tidy Data = Happy Data

> “Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” 


– Leo Tolstoy


> “Tidy datasets are all alike, but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.” 


– Hadley Wickham

##Tidy Data = Happy Data

Tidy Data has the following attributes:

Each variable forms a column and contains values

Each observation forms a row

Each type of observational unit forms a table

|Good Example   | Bad Example   | Description  |
|---|---|---|
|gnp2010   |gnp-2002; gnp#2002    |   |
|real_int    |real interest rate    |  |
| score1; gnp2003   | 1st_score; 2003gnp  |    |
|reg_out; glm1    | REG; glm; ttest   |   |
| invest; interest  | xxx; yyy; zmdje;   |    |
|male; asian    | gender; race   | |

##Variable Naming

|Good Example   | Bad Example   | Description  |
|---|---|---|
|gnp2010   |gnp-2002; gnp#2002    | avoid special characters  |
|real_int    |real interest rate    |Use underscore   |
| score1; gnp2003   | 1st_score; 2003gnp  | Begin with a character   |
|reg_out; glm1    | REG; glm; ttest   | Avoid reserved words  |
| invest; interest  | xxx; yyy; zmdje;   |Use meaningful names    |
|male; asian    | gender; race   | Use a value of dummy   |
| citizen   | Are_you_a_US_citizen?   | The shorter, the better   |
| income; intUS03   | INCOME; Int_us2003;   | Use lower cases   |
| 2017-04-20   |April 20, 2017   | Use common ISO year format  |
