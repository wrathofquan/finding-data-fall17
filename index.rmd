## Plan your Research with a Literature Review 



![](netflix.jpg)


## Some First Considerations


- How feasible or doable is your research question in the time given? 

- How many observations do you need? 

- Does the answer to your question have too many angles? 


		
## Structure and availability of data



| Unit of Analysis                                                                       	| Geography                                                                          	| Time-Period                                                             	| Frequency                                                                                              	|
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|-------------------------------------------------------------------------	|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| For which level do you want data?  Summary or Micro?  (individuals, counties, nations) 	| Is there a geographic  component to your topic?  (U.S., Sub-Saharan Africa, India) 	| Do you want a data for a  specific time period?  (1980-2000, 1930-1960) 	| How often do you want measures  for your variables?  (every year, every ten years, monthly, quarterly) 	|


## Data Providers

| Researchers                                                    	| Government Agencies                                                                                                                                                                       	| NGOs                                                                                                                                     	| Research Organizations                                                                                                   	|
|----------------------------------------------------------------	|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| Are there people you know who are doing this kind of research? 	| Think about government agencies - is the request for some official statistics or data that they'd be likely to collect and publish? (industry, agriculture, construction, disease, crime) 	| Are there councils or interest organizations devoted to the topic that might collect data independently? (HIV/AIDS, drugs, civil rights) 	| Would any specific research organizations be interested in the topic? (Pew, Roper, Gallup, NORC, NBER, World Bank, OECD) 	|

## Mind the 80/20 Rule

> It is often said that 80% of data analysis is spent on the process of cleaning and preparing the data. 


-Dasu and Johnson


## Tidy Data

> “Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” 

– Leo Tolstoy


> “Tidy datasets are all alike, but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.” 

– Hadley Wickham


##Tidy Data = Happy Data

Tidy Data has the following attributes:

Each variable forms a column and contains values

Each observation forms a row

library(dplyr)
ufo <- read_html("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFO_sightings_in_the_United_States")

ufo_date <- html_nodes(ufo,'td:nth-child(1)') %>% html_text() 
ufo_date <- ufo_date[c(-1, -44)] #remove extra elements
ufo_state <- html_nodes(ufo,'td:nth-child(3)') %>% html_text()
ufo_name <- html_nodes(ufo,'td:nth-child(4)') %>% html_text()
ufo_df<-data.frame(date = ufo_date, name = ufo_name, location = ufo_state)

head(ufo_df, n =5)

| What search features are available to you?  |           How do you access the data?                            |
| How is the data described?                                             | Are the years, unit of analysis, and geography appropriate for the question?                             |
| What formats are available?                                                                | Are there additional permissions for access? |
